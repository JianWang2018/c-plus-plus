Problem:Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

using namespace std;*/

vector<int>  Solution::twoSum(vector<int> &nums, int target)
{
    cout<<"hello_world"<<endl;
    vector<int> a;
    return a; 
}
